To improve this application design, I'd add additional alerting logic to monitor quick changes in traffic. 
This additional logic would detect if there's a large change in the number of requests every few seconds. 
The program should then print out whether there's high or low traffic. 
I would implement the logic in a similar way to the the two minute traffic detector. 
I'd check whether the total traffic in a few seconds time either dropped or exceeded the average amount of traffic.
If so, the application would then print that it detected a change in traffic.
