To improve this application design, I'd first add additional alerting logic to monitor instant change. 
I'd add logic so that if there's a large change in the number of requests in a few seconds, 
the program should print out whether there's high or low traffic. 
This change would be included with the two minute total traffic detector, 
so that there'd be diagnostic info on whether there was a large drop or increase in a short period of time.
I would implement this similarly to how I implemented the two minute traffic detector. 
I'd compare whether the total traffic in a few seconds time either dropped or exceeded the average amount of traffic.
